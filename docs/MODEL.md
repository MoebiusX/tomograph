# The ObservabilityPack model

The studio is a faithful renderer of the [ObservabilityPack spec
v1.2](../vendor/observability-pack-spec/v1.2/spec.md). The canonical model
— `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, `spec`, the ten dimensions L1–L5 — is
defined there; this document covers only the parts the studio adds or
shapes for the display, not the canonical model itself.

For the canonical model, read:

- **[`../vendor/observability-pack-spec/v1.2/spec.md`](../vendor/observability-pack-spec/v1.2/spec.md)** — §3 the conceptual model, §4 the manifest shape, §5 each dimension with conformance, §7 the maturity rubric summary.
- **[`../vendor/observability-pack-spec/v1.2/docs/maturity-model.md`](../vendor/observability-pack-spec/v1.2/docs/maturity-model.md)** — the full tier-3 → tier-2 → tier-1 clause rubric.
- **[`../vendor/observability-pack-spec/v1.2/examples/payment-service.pack.yaml`](../vendor/observability-pack-spec/v1.2/examples/payment-service.pack.yaml)** — the canonical example.

## What the studio adds — L2X (Extended Surfaces)

The canonical spec carves the manifest into ten dimensions across five
layers (L1 Contract, L2 Telemetry, L3 Insight, L4 Action, L5 Validation),
plus governance. The studio adds **one sub-layer** for display purposes:
**L2X · Extended Surfaces.**

L2X groups the optional, telemetry-adjacent spec sections that the v1.2
spec carved out as "extended technology surfaces" in §5.12.4 of the spec:

| Spec section | Artefact ID | Tool family |
|---|---|---|
| `spec.profiling` | `PROF-01` | Pyroscope, parca, … |
| `spec.network` | `NET-01` | Cilium, eBPF observability |
| `spec.policy_engine` | `POE-01` | OPA bundles |
| `spec.mesh[]` | `MESH-NN` | Envoy, Consul, Kong, Traefik |
| `spec.collection[]` | `COL-NN` | Fluent Bit, Beats, Vector, Alloy |

These all consume telemetry the same way L2 does, but they're optional and they reference (rather than declare) backends. Rendering them as a separate L2X tab keeps L2 focused on the core "produce + collect + persist" loop while still surfacing the extended surfaces when a pack declares them. The L2X tab is **hidden when empty** so packs without extended surfaces look uncluttered.

## What the studio adds — source tag taxonomy

Each artefact in the layered display carries one of three source tags
derived from canonical content:

| Tag | Derivation |
|---|---|
| `Declared` | The section is present in the manifest. This is the default. |
| `Verified` | The canonical pack has a flat annotation key `metadata.annotations["mcp.verified.<symbol>"]` set to a timestamp. The [refresh-live-pack workflow](../.github/workflows/refresh-live-pack.yml) writes these when MCP confirms an artefact. |
| `Missing` | Computed by the conformance pass: required at the declared `criticality` per the rubric, but absent from the manifest. See [CONFORMANCE.md](CONFORMANCE.md). |

The flat-key form is forced by the schema — `metadata.annotations` is declared as `{string: string}` with `additionalProperties: {type: string}`. Nested-object annotations would not validate.

## What the studio adds — environment overlay

A canonical pack with `spec.environments.<name>.{target, criticality, backends, overrides}` ships to the studio with all environments visible. The adapter takes an environment name (default = first env in the map), applies the env's dotted-path overrides (e.g. `storage.metrics.retention: 13mo`), and rewrites `metadata.bindings.criticality` + `metadata.bindings.default_target` from the env's effective values. Conformance is then scored against the effective tier — e.g. a tier-1 service on its `staging` overlay is scored against tier-2 clauses, because the staging environment declares itself tier-2.

See [ADAPTER.md](ADAPTER.md) for the full canonical → layered mapping.
