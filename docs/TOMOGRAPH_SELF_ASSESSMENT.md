# Is Tomograph Itself "Diagnostic Grade"?

### Holding the instrument to its own standard

This applies the eight-axis framework from `DIAGNOSTIC_GRADE_FRAMEWORK.md` to Tomograph itself. Tomograph *is* a measurement instrument: it produces a verdict ("Diagnostic Grade: PASS/FAIL") about whether a service's observability is good enough to trust. The fair question — and a strong one for a CIO audience — is whether that verdict is *itself* produced to diagnostic-grade standard.

**Scope.** The "instrument" here is the Tomograph pipeline that yields the Diagnostic Grade: crawler → adapter → posture matrix → `computeDiagnosticGrade` (8 criteria with fractional drift fidelity, PASS at >85% total score) → drift/diff against a live pack. Evidence is drawn from this codebase and the analyses run over this engagement.

**Headline verdict.** Tomograph is a **strong and improving *verification* instrument with a pioneering *calibration* axis, but it is not yet *diagnostic grade* by its own definition.** It excels at reproducibility and at the calibration/drift idea that most observability tooling lacks entirely. But it does not yet quantify its own sensitivity, specificity, detection limit, or verdict uncertainty against any ground truth, and it carries a residual trueness/bias risk: the crawler now honors per-environment `enabled: false` toggles, but the surrounding product contract — required environment selection, disabled components surfaced as evidence, like-for-like comparison scope — is still being specified (see `PHASE_1_VERDICT_TRUST_RESEARCH.md`, Workstream A). In metrology terms: **verified, not yet validated.**

## Scorecard

Rating scale: **Met** (demonstrated, with evidence) · **Partial** (present but incomplete or unquantified) · **Absent** (not implemented/measured).

| # | Axis | Rating | State today | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Validity** — measures the right thing | **Partial** | The grade mostly measures *declaration richness* (multi-modal, correlated, calibrated, comprehensive; actionable is informational since grade schema 2) on Pack A — "is the observability well-declared," not "is the service reliable." Only the Trust axis touches reality. Face validity is reasonable; criterion/construct validity (does a PASS predict fewer/shorter incidents?) is **never evidenced**. | `computeDiagnosticGrade` reads declared L1–L5 artefacts; no link to real incident outcomes anywhere in the grade. |
| 2 | **Reliability / reproducibility** — same input → same verdict | **Met** (given a fixed input) | The grade and diff are pure deterministic functions; the diff now preserves every artefact and a pack-vs-self scores `alignment = 1.0`, with a regression test locking it. This is Tomograph's strongest axis. | `tools/test-diff.mjs` (self-diff preserves artefacts, occurrence keys); deterministic `canonicalize`/`stableStringify`. |
| 3 | **Trueness / bias** — right on average, not systematically off | **Partial / improving** | A real **positive bias** was found: the crawler could over-declare by blending multiple deployment surfaces. The current mitigation tightens prod/local/EKS scoping and marks schema-required scaffold separately, but the product still needs a required environment choice. | Env-mixing analysis; crawler environment scoping; `crawler.scaffold.*` annotations. |
| 4 | **Sensitivity** — catches real degradations | **Absent** (as measured) | No incident ground-truth set; Tomograph never computes its own catch-rate or MTTD-against-reality. "Sensitivity"-like wording in the rubric refers to *coverage*, not detector recall. | grep of grade code: no `incident` / `catch-rate` / ground-truth concept. |
| 5 | **Specificity** — avoids false alarms | **Partial** | False-alarm/precision tracking against incident ground truth is still absent, but the largest known false-positive source is now reduced: out-of-scope live inventory and source-less scaffold are excluded from drift badness, and live-only shadow signals are low-weighted. | `outOfScope`, `Scaffold`, and weighted drift buckets in `compare-view.mjs`. |
| 6 | **Detection limit / resolution** — smallest real change reliably caught | **Partial / weak** | No notion of the smallest reliability change detectable. However, the verdict is no longer fully binary: drift-free contributes fractional credit proportional to weighted fidelity, so small drift improvements can move the score. No `a90/95` analogue yet. | fractional `drift-free.score`; weighted fidelity in `computeDiagnosticGrade`. |
| 7 | **Traceability / calibration** — anchored to a reference, re-anchored on a cadence | **Partial** | This is the genuinely novel part: declared-vs-live drift via MCP probes, weighted live fidelity, a probe-confirmation tolerance (30%), and a **freshness window (24h)** — i.e. calibration *with a calibration interval*. Remaining gaps: static conformance still scans the manifest, and "verified" is an annotation stamp rather than a first-class attestation. | `FRESH_WINDOW_MS = 24h`, `DRIFT_FAIL_TOLERANCE = 0.30`, weighted drift fidelity, `mcp.probesAttempted/refreshedAt`. |
| 8 | **Quantified uncertainty** — confidence + pre-declared, cost-justified target | **Partial / early** | The total PASS bar is still a policy threshold, but the drift-fidelity threshold now has a decision-cost rationale: weighted badness must stay below about 0.176 per confirmed artefact, roughly one high-cost false reassurance per six confirmed controls. A full confidence/uncertainty statement is still missing. | `DRIFT_BADNESS_PER_ALIGNED_TRUST_CEILING`; fractional score; no full confidence interval yet. |

### Meta-requirements

| Requirement | Rating | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **Validation > verification** (the spec must be adequate, not just met) | **Partial** | Tomograph straddles: conformance/coverage is *verification* (manifest checks); the drift/Trust axis is the *validation* attempt. But it labels a verification-heavy score "Diagnostic Grade," conflating the two — the exact trap VIM 2.45 warns against. |
| **Evidence discipline / auditability** (reportable, bias-appraised) | **Partial → Met** | Deterministic, inspectable, documented (`DIFF.md`), and now regression-tested. Missing: a STARD/QUADAS-equivalent appraisal of its *own* verdicts' accuracy. |

## What this means, in one paragraph

Tomograph reliably and reproducibly answers *"is this pack well-formed and does it match what we declared?"* — and uniquely, it begins to ask *"does the declaration match the live system?"* (calibration/drift), which is the single hardest and most valuable axis. What it does **not yet** do is the part that earns the word "diagnostic": it never measures whether its verdict **tracks reality** (validity), how often it **catches real incidents** (sensitivity) or **cries wolf** (specificity), the **smallest problem it can see** (detection limit), or **how confident** any given verdict is (uncertainty) — and a **residual over-declaration risk** remains at the product-contract level: gross environment mixing is mitigated by default environment scoping and scaffold annotation, and the crawler now honors per-environment `enabled: false` toggles (e.g. Prometheus disabled on EKS, which runs VictoriaMetrics, is excluded); what is not yet settled is the contract around it — required environment selection, disabled components surfaced as evidence, and like-for-like comparison scope across refresh/deploy/re-verify (`PHASE_1_VERDICT_TRUST_RESEARCH.md`, Workstream A). By the standard Tomograph is proposing for others, Tomograph is today an excellent **verification + drift** instrument, not yet a validated diagnostic one.

This is not a criticism so much as a roadmap — and a candid version of it is a *much* stronger talk than claiming the tool is already there.

## The shortest path to closing the gap

Ordered by leverage; each ties to an axis and to work already scoped this engagement.

1. **Fix trueness first (axis 3) — finish the environment contract.** The crawler already scopes environments and honors `enabled` toggles; what remains is the product contract: require an explicit environment choice, surface disabled components as evidence, emit `spec.environments` overlays, and compare like-for-like (EKS pack vs EKS live) across refresh, deploy, and re-verify (`PHASE_1_VERDICT_TRUST_RESEARCH.md`, Workstream A). This removes the systematic bias *and* repairs the calibration reference (axis 7). Highest leverage; everything downstream is noise until this is done.
2. **Make calibration honest (axis 7) + add uncertainty (axis 8).** Promote "verified/last-verified" to a first-class attestation with a freshness gate (a stale verification should fail regardless of static score), and attach a confidence/coverage statement to the verdict instead of a bare PASS/FAIL. Keep deriving thresholds from explicit cost-of-miss arguments.
3. **Earn validity, sensitivity, specificity (axes 1, 4, 5) — the hard, decisive part.** Keep a labelled set of past incidents and back-test: did a PASS verdict correspond to fewer/shorter incidents (validity)? what fraction of real incidents did the declared alerts catch within MTTD (sensitivity)? what fraction of fired alerts were noise (specificity)? Report these as the tool's own ROC-style operating point. This is what converts "verification tool" into "diagnostic-grade instrument," and it's exactly the analytical-vs-clinical-validity split from IVD.
4. **Add a resolution statement (axis 6).** Define and report the smallest budget-burn / SLO degradation the pipeline reliably flags — an "a90/95 for observability."

When 1–4 are in place, Tomograph will be able to say of *itself* what it asks of every service: here is our validity, our sensitivity and specificity at a stated operating point, our detection limit, our calibration freshness, and the uncertainty on our verdict — measured, not asserted.
