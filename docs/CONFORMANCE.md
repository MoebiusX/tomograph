# Conformance

The conformance scorer (`tools/lib/conformance.mjs`) evaluates a canonical
pack against a hand-curated subset of the maturity rubric from
[spec §5 + §7](../vendor/observability-pack-spec/v1.2/spec.md). The studio
exposes the scoring in the conformance view and via
`GET /api/packs/:id/conformance?env=<name>`.

## Rubric

30 clauses across L1–L5 plus L2X. Each clause is `{ id, dimension, severity, minTier, description, specRef, evaluate }`:

- `severity`: `MUST` (weight 1) or `SHOULD` (weight 0.5).
- `minTier`: the least-stringent tier at which the clause applies. Rank `tier-3 < tier-2 < tier-1`. A clause with `minTier: tier-3` applies to every pack; one with `minTier: tier-1` only applies to tier-1 packs.
- `evaluate(canonical) → boolean`: run against the env-overlaid spec.
- `specRef`: section in the upstream spec.md where the rule is defined.

The rubric is intentionally **content-focused** — schema-enforced rules (e.g. "every SLO has `objective + window`") aren't duplicated here because the validator already covers them. Conformance only checks what sits above the schema floor.

|---|---|---|---|---|

## Scoring

```
must.passed   = applicable MUSTs that pass
must.total    = applicable MUSTs
should.passed = applicable SHOULDs that pass
should.total  = applicable SHOULDs

mustPercent    = must.passed / must.total * 100
scorePercent   = (must.passed + 0.5*should.passed) / (must.total + 0.5*should.total) * 100
conformant     = must.passed === must.total   (per spec §8 definition)
```

## Bundled-pack scores

| Pack | Tier | MUST | SHOULD | Conformant |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `demo-skeleton.pack.yaml` | tier-3 | 9/9 (100%) | 0/0 | yes |
| `production-curated.pack.yaml` | tier-2 | 13/15 (87%) | 0/1 | no — 2 honest gaps |
| `target-advanced.pack.yaml` | tier-1 | 25/25 (100%) | 5/5 (100%) | yes |
| `payment-service.pack.yaml` (canonical example) | tier-1 | 21/25 (84%) | 5/5 (100%) | no — 4 orphan SLOs |

The canonical example itself fails 4 MUSTs (`L3.MUST.recording_rule_per_slo`, `L4.MUST.multi_window_burn_rate`, `L5.MUST.tier1_chaos_for_each_slo`, `L5.MUST.tier1_weekly_prod_chaos`) because two of its five SLOs (`api_latency_99_p99_500ms`, `consumer_success_99_95`) aren't covered by a recording rule, burn-rate alert, or chaos experiment. The studio surfaces these as red-X items in the conformance view — visible drift the spec's own reference example carries.

## Extending the rubric

Each clause is a self-contained `{...}` block in `tools/lib/conformance.mjs`. Add new ones inline with their `specRef`. The server's `GET /api/maturity-rubric` will pick them up automatically; `tools/test-packs.mjs` will re-score every bundled pack against the new clause set.
